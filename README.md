## Arise Alarm App
### Inspiration
Are you tired of oversleeping and missing important events or appointments? Do you struggle to wake up on time, especially for early morning classes or meetings? If so, you're not alone. Many students and professionals face the challenge of getting out of bed when the alarm goes off. The Arise alarm app was inspired by the common struggle of waking up on time and aims to provide a solution.

### What it Does
Arise is more than just a standard alarm app. It consists of both a web and mobile component designed to revolutionize your morning routine. The mobile component functions like a typical alarm app, allowing users to set alarms and receive audible alerts at specified times. However, what sets Arise apart is what happens after the alarm sounds.

Unlike traditional alarm apps that offer standard options like snooze or cancel, Arise takes a different approach. Instead of simply silencing the alarm with a tap, Arise requires users to interact with a link that only works on their computer or non-mobile device. Once they open this link, they are presented with a small, fun, and engaging task that must be completed before the alarm is turned off.

### How it Works
Set Your Alarms: Use the mobile component of Arise to create alarms for all your important events and appointments. Wake Up Engaged: When the alarm goes off, you won't be able to turn it off with a simple tap. Instead, you'll need to complete a task on your computer or non-mobile device. Start Your Day Right: By engaging with a task before turning off the alarm, you'll kickstart your morning with productivity and positivity.
